## 📋 How It Works

This project uses **Redux** to manage global UI and app state, while **React Query** handles all server data fetching and caching, reducing boilerplate and improving performance. Fetching and mutation logic becomes declarative and efficient, and data updates automatically synchronize with UI components.

Styled Components allows writing scoped CSS inside the components themselves, leading to maintainable and reusable styles.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Hotel internal systems like this help streamline operations including:

* Tracking room availability
* Managing check-in/check-out workflows
* Viewing guest data
* Making quick updates without full page reloads

This app demonstrates how real-world CRUD apps can be built using modern React ecosystem tools.
